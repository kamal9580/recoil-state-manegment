## Recoil State Management in React

## Introduction

Recoil is a state management library for React that provides a simple and powerful way to manage application state. it provides features like atoms, selectors, and atom effects.

## Atoms and Selectors

Atoms are the fundamental units of state in Recoil. They represent a piece of state that can be read from and written to.

Use the `useRecoilState` hook to read from and write to an atom

Selectors derive state from atoms or other selectors. They are used to compute derived state.

Use the `useRecoilValue` hook to read from a selector
